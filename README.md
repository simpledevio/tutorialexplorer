# Tutorial Explorer

This adds a Tutorial Explorer Tree View to the Explorer that lets you view Markdown files stored in a `.tutorial` folder.

If you're a tutorial writer and want to write tutorials that are compatible with this extension, create a project folder and then create a `.tutorial` folder inside it. Put your .md files in there. Use numbers at the beginning of the file names to give them a specific order. Then publish your project on GitHub and developers can clone or download your project and use this extension to go through the lessons.
